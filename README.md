# AI Blog Platform with Chatbot

## 📌 Project Overview

An AI-powered blog platform integrated with an intelligent chatbot. The chatbot uses the blog content as its primary knowledge base to answer user queries. If the required information is not found within the blog, it fetches relevant data from online sources and provides reference links.
